## About Me

Hi, I’m **Divyash Chtetri**, a passionate **Web Developer** and a **BCA student specializing in Cloud Computing and Cyber Security** at Medhavi Skill University. I love building digital experiences that are **clean, secure, and meaningful** — from sleek portfolio websites to complete web solutions.

My journey in tech began with a simple curiosity about how websites work, and it quickly turned into a deep passion for **creating, securing, and scaling web applications**. I enjoy working across both frontend and backend, ensuring that every project I build is not just functional, but also **reliable and visually balanced**.

I believe technology isn’t just about code — it’s about **focus, creativity, and impact**. Every line I write aims to make something a little more **efficient, beautiful, and safe**.

When I’m not coding, I spend my time exploring new tools in **AI, cloud infrastructure, and web security**, or **meditating** to keep a clear, focused mind for my next big idea.
